# Libararies and Language

IQuHACK is a python specific conference as such we will be using the most recent version of python, 3.13.0. The most common QC libraries used in previous years challenges are [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit), [Q#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/qsharp-overview), and [cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq). We have a small list of **TBD** items:
- OS
- IDE
- Git Basics?

# Topics from Previous Years

- QC applied to the rydberg blockade
- Image classifcaiton
- Model Quantum systems to be run on QC
- Encryption breaking
- Optimization of linear optics gates
